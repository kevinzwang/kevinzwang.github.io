    <h1>Kevin Wang</h1>
    <p>Hi there! Kevin here. This Github Page is where I'll aggregate all my cool Github projects. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2018">Team 199 Robot Code 2018</a>
    </h2>
    <p>FRC Team 199: Deep Blue's repo for our 2018 robot code. I led a team to work on autonomous driving.</p>

    <h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/kevinzwang/marvin-python">Marvin</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Discord bot I wrote in Python, used to administrate and entertain my Discord server "Chaos".</p>

    <h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/kevinzwang/tshirt-design">Carlmont CS T-shirt Design Submission</a>
    </h2>
    <p>My t-shirt design submission is completely generated by code, and is slightly different every time you reload the page.
        Although it ultimately did not win, it still taught me a good deal about Javascript and front end development, which
        I ended up applying in my later projects.</p>
